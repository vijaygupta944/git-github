# Git & GitHub - Hands-On Practice Repository  

Hands-on Git & GitHub practice repository demonstrating real-world workflows like branching, rebasing, conflict resolution, stash, cherry-pick, reflog recovery, and PR-based collaboration.

## Repository Purpose

This repository is created to **practice Git & GitHub hands-on**, exactly the way they are used in **real corporate projects**.

> This is **not theory or notes**.  
> Every concept here has been **executed practically** using local repositories, branches, commits, merges, rebases, and GitHub pushes.

## What This Repository Proves:

- I initialized Git repositories locally  
- I made real commits with meaningful messages  
- I worked with multiple branches  
- I merged feature branches into main  
- I resolved merge conflicts manually  
- I rebased branches to maintain clean history  
- I recovered lost work using `git reflog`  
- I practiced stash, cherry-pick, reset, diff  
- I pushed code to GitHub using real workflows  

This repo exists as **evidence of practice**, not learning notes.

## Practical Setup Performed

- Installed Git and VS Code
- Initialized repo using `git init`
- Configured Git identity (`user.name`, `user.email`)
- Used **Git Graph extension** to visualize commits
- Created initial commit using `README.md` (industry standard)
